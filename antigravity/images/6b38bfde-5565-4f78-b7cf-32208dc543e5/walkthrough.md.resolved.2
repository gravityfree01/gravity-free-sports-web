# Walkthrough - GRAVITYFREE Minimalist Redesign

We have successfully completed the redesign of the GRAVITYFREE website, transitioning to a **Minimalist Light Gallery** aesthetic inspired by your reference image.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Minimalist Light Theme ([style.css](file:///c:/Users/gravi/catchbat01%20Dropbox/PARK%20SEONGSOO/PC/Desktop/antigravity/style.css))
- **Clean Aesthetic**: Pure white backgrounds, soft grey sectioning, and bold black typography.
- **Gallery Layout**: Restructured the landing page into a clean grid that emphasizes high-impact product imagery and whitespace.

### 2. High-Resolution Asset Generation
Integrated custom-generated, studio-quality images for all key products:
- **Motion V**: Sleek motion sensor product shot.
- **GSG**: Professional 3D Doppler Radar device.
- **G-Fit**: Modern pneumatic cable conditioning system.
- **Custom Gear**: Macro shots of artisan gloves and premium uniforms.
- **Hero**: Atmospheric sports performance imagery with data overlays.

### 3. Interactive Video Gallery
Added high-impact video engagement features to the product gallery:
- **Hover Transitions**: Mousing over G-Fit, Motion V, or GSG cards smoothly transitions the studio product shot into a YouTube thumbnail preview.
- **Embedded Player**: Clicking on a product opens a minimalist, non-intrusive YouTube modal for immediate video viewing without leaving the page.
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover "Play" overlays provide clear visual cues for interactivity.

### 4. Updated Brand Identity & Contact Info
Updated the footer across all pages (`index`, `contact`, `products`) with the correct information:
- **E-mail**: gravityfree01@gmail.com
- **Tel**: 010-9061-2214
- **Address**: 경기도 파주시 탄현면 참매매길 160, 2층

### 4. Fully Responsive Design
The new layout is optimized for both professional desktop viewing and on-field mobile accessibility for coaches.
