# Implementation Plan - GRAVITYFREE MVP (Structure & Copy)

Building a high-performance B2B landing page for GRAVITYFREE SPORTS, focusing on "Data over Intuition".

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Headline Strategy**: "훈련은 감이 아니라, 데이터입니다." (Training is not intuition, it's data). This will be the central theme throughout all pages.

> [!NOTE]
> **Product Narrative**: Instead of listing features, we focus on the problem-solving aspect: "Why do trainers and athletes need this data?"

## Proposed Changes

### [Landing Page (index.html)]
- **Hero**: Core headline + Brand definition.
- **Problem**: "Still training by 'feeling'?" Highlight the inconsistency of intuition-based training.
- **System Flow**: Connectivity between Motion V, GSG, and G-Fit for a complete performance ecosystem.
- **Products**: Brief intro to the 3 main devices + Custom gear.
- **Trust**: domestic A/S, reasonable pricing, pro-player usage.
- **CTA**: B2B inquiry button.

### [Product Detail Pages]
- **products/motion-v.html**: Focus on "Ground Reaction & Kinematics". Why visual data beats verbal coaching for movement correction.
- **products/gsg.html**: Focus on "Doppler Radar Precision". Tracking what the eye misses (Exit speed, Launch angle).
- **products/g-fit.html**: Focus on "Kinetic Chain Power". Sustaining power through efficient energy flow.

### [Contact Page (contact.html)]
- Form optimized for B2B: Company Name, Role, Interested Device, Estimated Athletes, Budget/Schedule.

### [Placeholders]
- For missing images, we will use high-end CSS skeletons or SVG diagrams that explain the data visualization (e.g., radar charts, ground force vectors).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Verify the copy flow matches the user's "Why it's needed" requirement.
2. Test lead form fields for B2B relevance.
3. Check mobile responsiveness.
