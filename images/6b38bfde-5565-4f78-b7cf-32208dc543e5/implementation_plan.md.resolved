- Shrink `.hero-overlay-logo img` to fit the gap between athletes' heads.
- Reposition `.hero-overlay-logo` to the top-center of the hero image.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Confirm the new hero image has the correct English labels for both athletes.
2. Verify the hero logo size and position match the user's "between heads" requirement.
3. Check for any text overlapping or readability issues.
